How to run the NIST CCVS85 (aka. ANSI85) Test Suite
=====================================

*NOTE* It is expected that WARNING messages appear when running the test.

*NOTE* The language interpreter "perl" is required to run these tests.

The final command of the the test is a diff between expected results and
actual results, i.e. "diff summary.txt summary.log".
If there is any output from this command, please tar and compress the
complete cobol85 directory and report this to the GnuCOBOL mailing list.
You will receive further instructions where to send this.

*NOTE* This test can take a long time depending on your hardware.

1. Prerequisite: test suite "newcob.val", EITHER -
a) Manually download the test archive "newcob.val.Z" from
   http://www.itl.nist.gov/div897/ctg/cobol_form.htm

   Uncompress it and move the file newcob.val to the tests/cobol85 directory

b) Automatic download/uncompress
   If the test suite is not available "make test" will uncompress the archive
   "newcob.val.Z" from tests/cobol85.
   If the test archive is also missing "make test" will try to download the
   archive beforehand.

2. Run the test suite:
   make test

3. Test report summary will be put in summary.log.

4. When rerunning the tests as a result of a change, always do a "make clean"
   *before* "make test"

5. The default tests configured for GnuCOBOL are:
   NC SM IC SQ RL IX ST SG OB IF DB
   Note: IX will be skipped if ISAM access was disabled during configure.
